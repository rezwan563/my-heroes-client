### My Heroes

#### Website description

* This is a ecomerce site for action figures( **Avengers**, **Star trek**, **Transformers**)
* All products are kids friendly

You can browse this site to find your favourite toys. You can see list of all products added in **All toys** page. However, **My_Toys** **Add a Toy** and **Toy details** page are in private route. So, a user has to sign in/create account to view those page.

* Some tools that are used in making  of this site are **firebase**, **tailwind**, **daiysiUi**, **react-router**, **mongodb**

Interesting part of this project was the backend. Storing data to mongodb server was the easiest part of CRUD operations. Tricky part for me was the sorting, and search options. I am not sure how to implement these two. And also the react-tabs requirements is not clear. I have some time. Let's see what happens!
